# Repository Administration Setup Guide

This guide is for repository administrators to configure the required settings for this project.

## Setting Up Branch Protection Rules

To ensure code quality and prevent accidental breaking changes, please set up the following branch protection rules for the `main` branch:

1. Navigate to the repository settings on GitHub
2. Go to "Branches" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Branch protection rules", click "Add rule"
4. For the "Branch name pattern", enter `main`
5. Enable the following settings:
   - ✓ Require pull request reviews before merging
     - ✓ Require approval from at least 1 reviewer
   - ✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
     - ✓ Require branches to be up to date before merging
     - Add the following status checks as required:
       - `test` (runs unit tests for all components)
       - `build` (builds Docker images)
   - ✓ Do not allow bypassing the above settings
   - ✓ Restrict who can push to matching branches (add repository administrators)
6. Click "Create" to save the rule

## Setting Up Repository Secrets

For the GitHub Actions workflow to run properly, the following secrets might need to be set up:

1. Navigate to the repository settings on GitHub
2. Go to "Secrets and variables" → "Actions" in the left sidebar
3. Click "New repository secret" to add each of the following secrets if needed:
   - `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` - Username for Docker Hub
   - `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` - Access token for Docker Hub
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Production database URL (if needed)

## Managing Workflow Permissions

To allow GitHub Actions to approve PRs, you need to configure workflow permissions:

1. Navigate to the repository settings on GitHub
2. Go to "Actions" → "General" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Workflow permissions", select "Read and write permissions"
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

## Additional CI/CD Configuration

You may need to set up additional CI/CD integration with:

1. Code coverage reporting
2. Automated dependency updates
3. Security scanning
4. Deployment automation

Please refer to the project documentation for specific requirements.
